# WooCommerce Attribute Description

WooCoomerce have not yet provided a way in their plugin to display descriptions at attribute level. 

We have developed a plugin for a customer which shows a '?' icon next to each attribute (within a variable product) in the front end, that when clicked pops up a modal that displays the description assigned by the admin in the backend.
