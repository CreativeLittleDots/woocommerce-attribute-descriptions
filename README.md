## WooCommerce Attribute Descriptions

WooCommerce Attribute Descriptions extends WooCommerce and adds customisable descriptions to Product Attributes on Variable Products

Sometimes you need to provide more information regarding product attributes, especially when customers have to decipher what they need from a variable product, WooCommerce Attribute Descriptions provides this exact functionality.

**Note:** This only works with attributes that are added via Products > Attributes and does not currently work with arbitrary attributes added at Single Product level.

## Screenshot

![Example 1](screenshots/example-1.png?raw=true "Example 1")

Simple enter some descriptive content in to the newly added text area on a Product Attribute.

![Example 2](screenshots/example-1.png?raw=true "Example 2")

When adding the Attribute to a Product, lets say a Variable Product for example, you will see a question mark next the attribute name on the Single Product template.

![Example 3](screenshots/example-1.png?raw=true "Example 3")

When you click on the question mark you will be able to read the Product Attribute content.
